The EVM Jello Paper
===================

The Jello Paper is an attempt at defining the EVM semantics using the `KEVM project <https://github.com/anon293409324/evm-semantics>`_.
Unlike the `Yellow Paper <http://yellowpaper.io.>`_, the Jello Paper is an executable semantics, and can provide a full EVM interpreter 
usable for testing contracts, analyzing gas usage, verifying contracts correct, and a wide range of other tasks as specified in the
`technical report on KEVM <ANONYMIZED>`_.
