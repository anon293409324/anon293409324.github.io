<h1>EVM Design Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#evm-design-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The EVM was the first successful general-purpose distributed
programmable blockchain platform, but that doesn’t make it without
fault. There are several issues with both the specification of the EVM
(in the Yellow Paper), and with the general design of the EVM. Most of
these issues are written from the perspective of someone trying to do
formal verification of the EVM.</p>
<div class="section" id="issues-with-description-of-evm">
<h2>Issues with description of EVM<a class="headerlink" href="#issues-with-description-of-evm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These can be ambiguities/confusing wording in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper">Yellow
Paper</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In section 9.4.2, exceptions are described as if they are all
catchable before an opcode is executed. While you may be able to
implement EVM in this way, it’s not clear that it’s best (you have to
duplicate computation), and we also are pretty sure no implementation
even does this (including the C++ one). Instead they throw exceptions
when they happen and roll-back the state (which is what you would
expect to happen). Our original implementation tried to do it the way
the Yellow Paper described, and it made everything harder/slower.</li>
<li>Again in section 9.4.2, it specifies that “these are the only ways
exceptions can happen when executing”. This doesn’t help with
building implementations, because there is at least one other case
that isn’t described. For example, if the memory is overflown, then
the existing semantics doesn’t do anything. Should it throw an
exception?</li>
<li>Some operators which access data of other accounts don’t specify
explicitly what to do if the other account doesn’t exist.
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">EXTCODESIZE</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">EXTCODECOPY</span></code> examples, though strangely enough
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BALANCE</span></code> does specify what to do. We think the community has
reached agreement on this though, “non-existing accounts are empty
accounts” or something along those lines.</li>
<li>What about contracts that have “junk bytes” in them? We’ve seen a
contract with “junk bytes”, and use cases of contracts with junk
bytes do exist. For example, if you want to use some large chunk of
data to be used in your contract but don’t want to perform a
sequences of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PUSH</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CODECOPY</span></code> can be used to move the junk
bytes into memory.</li>
<li>The description in Appendix H of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CALLCODE</span></code> instruction
describes it as like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CALL</span></code> except for the fourth argument to the
Theta function. However, it does not mention that this change from
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Mu_s[1]</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">I_a</span></code> also applies to the specification of
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C_NEW</span></code>.</li>
<li>The description in Appendix H of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DELEGATECALL</span></code> instruction
describes the gas provided to the caller as equal to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Mu_s[0]</span></code>.
However, this is clearly not the correct behavior, since <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Mu_s[0]</span></code>
is a user-provided value, and the user could set it equal to 2^256 -
1, leading to the user having an infinite amount of gas. It’s clear
from the test suite that the intended behavior is to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ccallgas</span></code>
but with the value for the value transfer equal to 0. It also
describes the exceptional condition of not enough balance in terms of
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">I_v</span></code>, but in fact no value transfer occurs so this condition
should never occur.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="issues-with-design-of-evm">
<h2>Issues with design of EVM<a class="headerlink" href="#issues-with-design-of-evm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>More broadly, many features of the EVM seem to be poorly designed. These
can be issues from simple “why did they do it that way?” to “this makes
doing formal reasoning about EVM harder”.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Precompiled contracts: Why are there 4 precompiled contracts? Calls
into address 1 - 4 result in a “precompiled” contract being called
(most of them some sort of cryptographic function). There are plenty
of opcodes free, we should just have those precompiled contracts be
accessed through primitives (like how <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SHA3</span></code> is done). Another
(albeit unlikely problem) is that of address-space collisions.</li>
<li>The byte-aligned local memory makes reasoning about EVM programs much
more difficult. Say, for instance, that you write two Words (256-bit)
contiguously to local memory (which takes up addresses 0 - 64), then
shift between them and read a word (say between addresses 16 - 48).
If one of those words was symbolic, the resulting symbolic word is a
mess of an expression involving the original words. Of course, in
theory this is possible to reason about, but effectively this allows
taking one symbolic value and turning it into 32 symbolic values.
This makes symbolic execution much slower/more painful. Note also
that attempting to use bit-vectors, where you have one symbolic
boolean variable per bit, is currently infeasible with the existing
SMT solvers like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3</a>; while it
works with 32-bit words in some program verifiers, it is disarmingly
slow with 64-bit words and we failed to prove anything with 256-bit
words.</li>
<li>Program representation is important in EVM (that is, you must be able
to represent a program as a byte-array of opcodes). When doing
program analysis/abstract verification, you ideally would be allowed
to make transformations on the program representation (e.g., convert
it to a control-flow graph) without having to maintain a translation
back. Currently in EVM, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*CODECOPY</span></code> opcodes allow regarding
program pieces as data, meaning that a translation back must always
be maintained, because in theory a program can modify itself while
executing. For this reason, we had to build a parser/unparser and an
assembler/dissasembler into our semantics. Putting a symbolic value
through the process of disassembling -&gt; unparsing loses a lot of
semantic information about the original value. While self-modifying
code is nice and powerful in principle, we are not aware of any
programming languages for the blockchain that encourage or even allow
that.</li>
<li>In section H.2, the Yellow Paper states “All arithmetic is modulo
2^256 unless otherwise noted.” Reasoning “modulo” is very complex
with the current SMT provers and it was indeed a, if not the most
major difficulty in our <a class="reference external" href="proofs">EVM verification efforts</a>.
Additionally, the programs (smart contracts) we verified turned out
to be wrong, in the sense that they showed unintended behavior, in
the presence of arithmetic overflows anyway. That is, arithmetic
overflows were not expected to happen by the developers, so adding
code to deal with the “modulo 2^256” behavior in case of arithmetic
overflow was not even considered. In such situations, it would be a
lot better to simply throw an exception when arithmetic overflow
occurs, thus indicating that something bad happened, than to default
to “modulo 2^256” and ending up with a program computing wrong
values. We conjecture that words of 256 bits should be long enough
for the current smart contract needs to afford to abruptly terminate
computations when the limit is reached.</li>

<div class="section" id="recommendations-for-the-future">
<h2>Recommendations for the Future<a class="headerlink" href="#recommendations-for-the-future" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the above mentioned issues, there are several things that
could be improved about EVM in general as a distributed computation
language. Here we mention some.</p>
<div class="section" id="deterministic-vs-nondeterministic-and-proof-of-work-and-scalability">
<h3>Deterministic vs. Nondeterministic (and Proof of Work and Scalability)<a class="headerlink" href="#deterministic-vs-nondeterministic-and-proof-of-work-and-scalability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Because EVM is deterministic, it takes as long to verify a computation
as it takes to run a computation. In both cases, the entire program must
be executed; there is no choice about what the next step to take is.</p>
<p>In a nondeterministic language, execution is finding one execution path
among many which “solves” the program. For example, any logical language
where there are several possible next inference steps is
nondeterministic (eg. Prolog, Maude, K, Coq). However, once a solution
is found, presenting it is telling which choices were made at each
nondeterministic step; verifying it is following that same sequence of
steps. If at each step there are a choice from <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M</span></code> inference rules,
and it takes <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code> steps to reach a solution, then the speedup in
verifying is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M^n</span></code>.</p>
<p>One of the goals in a consensus-driven distributed store is scalability,
which means as more resources are added to the network the network gets
stronger. Using a deterministic language means that we lose at least one
dimension of this scalability; everyone verifying the state of the world
must do as much work as it took to compute the state of the world. Even
many functional languages, by having evaluation strategies settled ahead
of time, are deterministic (though they may have elegant ways of
encoding nondeterministic systems).</p>
<p>On the other hand, what secures many of these blockchain-consensus
systems is proof of work. Proof of work is the ultimate
non-deterministic programming language; the programs are the blocks
(before adding the nonce), and the solutions are the nonce added to the
blocks so that it hashes low enough. When using a nonce of size <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2^N</span></code>,
there are exactly <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">2^N</span></code> next “inference steps”, and they all must
be searched uniformly to find a solution. If instead the underlying
programming language had some nondeterminism, some of the proof of work
could be done <em>just by executing the transactions going into the block</em>.
Perhaps the two can be used to augment each other, allowing for some of
the proof of work to be provided via finding a solution to the program
and the rest via hashing.</p>
<p>If such a system were implemented, it may be important to incentivize
miners to supply solutions to programs/proofs on the blockchain. Perhaps
a system where the time between when a specification/theorem is
submitted to the blockchain and when it is solved determines the reward
for the computation could be used. Natural incentive to place proofs of
theorems on the blockchain would be provided in the form of the reward;
this means it’s against the miners interests to ignore transactions. The
hard part is incentivizing placing theorems on the blockchain early (as
it may be advantageous to hoard theorems so that you can submit
solutions early to collect the reward).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="termination">
<h3>Termination<a class="headerlink" href="#termination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The gas mechanic in EVM is designed to ensure that every program
terminates so that users can’t DOS the miners by submitting infinite
computations. However, there is no such guarantee that the proof of work
computation done by miners terminates; there may be no combination of
ordering of transactions and a nonce that yields a solution (though this
is incredibly improbable). Instead, we can leave it up to the miner to
decide if pursuing a computation is worth the time lost in the pursuit.
Indeed, this directly increases the amount of work possible behind a
proof of work, as much more useless work has been added to the system
(via computations that don’t terminate).</p>
<p>In many sufficiently powerful nondeterministic languages, there will be
plenty of execution search paths which do not terminate. However,
automated provers (execution engines) for these languages don’t throw up
their hands, instead they design better search tactics for the language.
It’s not clear that leaving the burden of which transactions to attempt
to the miner is entirely bad, especially when coupled with a system
which rewards more for longer-standing transactions.</p>
<p>The problem with this, it turns out, is not that users may DOS miners,
but that miners may DOS other miners (by presenting blocks that they
purport terminate).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="language-independence">
<h3>Language Independence<a class="headerlink" href="#language-independence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Language independence is difficult to achieve in a distributed system
because everyone must agree on how programs are to be executed. Two
approaches are the <em>language-building language</em> approach and the
<em>consensus-based</em> approach.</p>
<p>In the language-building language approach, the underlying language of
the blockchain is a language-building language. Thus, contracts are free
to introduce new languages simply as specifications (programs) in the
underlying language, and other contracts may use those languages by
referring to the language definition contract. As a very simple example,
if the underlying language was K, then you could submit a contract that
is just a K definition giving semantics to the language you want to use
in the future. Along this line, we should use a logical framework as the
underlying language. Logical frameworks exhibit both non-determinism and
language independence, making two improvements to EVM at the same time.</p>
<p>The consensus-based approach is more flexible in the interpretation of
“correct” executions of programs. Essentially, everyone would vote on
which execution is correct by rejecting ill-formed blocks (ill-formed
here includes blocks which do not report a correct execution). This lets
the definition of the underlying languages evolve out of band; major
changes to the semantics would essentially require widespread network
agreement or a fork. Indeed, the only thing that should be stored on the
blockchain would be a hash of the program.</p>
<p>These two techniques could perhaps be combined.</p>
